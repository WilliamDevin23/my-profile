            <h2>Hi! Let Me Introduce Myself</h2>
            <p class="reading">
              My name is <strong>William Devin</strong>. I am currently a
              7<sup>th</sup>-semester Informatics student at Gunadarma
              University. I am deeply interested in Mathematics, Machine
              Learning, and Deep Learning. Thanks to my curiosity, I have made
              significant self-improvements over the past year. Starting as a
              student with no programming experience, I spent four semesters
              feeling lost before discovering my passion for Machine Learning
              and Data Analytics. I began learning these fields through various
              MOOCs, including Dicoding, which helped me build a solid
              foundation in Data Analytics and Machine Learning.

            <h2>My Journey at Dicoding</h2>
            <p class="reading">
              I took my first step at Dicoding by participating in IDCamp 2023,
              choosing the Machine Learning Path. I successfully completed all
              the assigned courses and earned five certificates. While my
              performance was decent, I didnâ€™t advance to the intermediate
              level. Nonetheless, these courses paved the way for me to take on
              greater challenges.

            <h2>Thriving at Bangkit Academy 2024</h2>
            <p class="reading">
              I had heard about Bangkit Academy even before taking IDCamp 2023.
              The time was ideal since I would be in 6<sup>th</sup> semester
              when the event is held. I chose the same Learning Path as I did in
              IDCamp 2023. Took the admission tests, got accepted, and started
              my adventure on February 2024.
            </p>
            <p class="reading">
              Became a Machine Learning Cohort, I was required to finish all the
              courses. This is the moment where I got a big pile of valuable
              knowledges. Started from Python, Github, Data Analytics,
              Mathematics, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and finally
              Tensorflow, I could tell that the curriculum is well-organized. In
              addition, cohorts also got soft skills and English classes. At the
              near end of the event, every cohort must work for a capstone
              project in a team consisting of 6-7 cohorts.
            </p>
            <p class="reading">
              For the capstone project, we tried making a QnA chatbot, given a
              default information, and disease predictions given the symptoms.
              The model performance isn't that good due to data insufficient and
              resource intensive. However, we were managed to finish the project
              and got 89.5 score for the project.
            </p>
            <p class="reading">
              At last, I managed to graduate as a Distinction, got 94.23 final
              score and made it to the top 10% of the final score.

            <p class="reading">
              I engage myself in many learning programs, such as IDCamp 2024,
              take React Developer Path. I register for elevAIte with Dicoding
              Program 2025, learning on Microsoft Learn Platform. Besides, in
              7<sup>th</sup>
              semester, I have just done a web development project with my
              friends, utilizing Next.JS for both front-end and back-end. I
              believe that youth couldn't be attained once it has passed, thus I
              tried to be productive as possible and take any learning or work
              opportunities.

            <p class="reading">
              I'm also preparing myself for my undergraduate thesis, while
              looking for internship, part-time, or full-time job opportunities.
